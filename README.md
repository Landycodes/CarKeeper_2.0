# Maintenace made easy!

This app was built to help your average DIY car mechanic keep track of basic car maintenance intervals. To use the app, you can simply log in or create an account, and then the user will be presented with a maintenance page. From there, all you have to do is enter the service you performed and the current vehicle mileage, and click enter. The dashboard will auto-populate with the mileage at which the service you performed is due next!

When the user clicks the car icon on the top right of the page, a menu will appear. "Set intervals" allows you to change the mileage interval for each service. "Specifications" is a page where you can input details about your car such as make, model, and VIN number. "Part status" allows you to keep track of tire tread depth and brake wear.

All of the user's inputs will be saved and stored to their account for the next time they need to be referenced.
